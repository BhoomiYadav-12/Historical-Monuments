The use of pyramidal structures with progressively smaller tiers stacked on top of each other to form a vimana above the sanctum of the temple is another key characteristic of this architecture. 
The vimanas are often elaborately carved and adorned with sculptures of deities and celestial beings.
Various dynasties and rulers have patronized temple construction over the centuries, influenced by subtle styles incorporated into the Dravidian architecture.
